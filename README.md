# Panda Schedule

## What is this project?
Panda Schedule is a schedule organiser designed to make it easier to deliver work on time.

## Why was it built?
I thought that it was too hard to organise workloads without paying, so, since I love coding, I decided to make this! It is named Panda Schedule because I am TheCodingPanda.
